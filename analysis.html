                    Tacitus is built for the <span class="accent">resolution gap</span> – the distance between
                    recognizing that a situation is dangerous and actually knowing what sequence of moves could
                    de-escalate it. Rather than treating disputes as sentiment or “angry text blobs”, Tacitus
                    constructs a shared <strong>graph of power, polarization, and constraints</strong> that all
                    products in the stack draw from: the Conflict Intelligence Engine, Prism Lab, and the Ontology Graph.

                    are encoded as vectors, how power and risk are measured, and how polarization is monitored as
                    a <em>pre-conflict trajectory</em>.

                <p class="stat-desc">
                    The ontology sits at the intersection of <strong>systems thinking</strong>
                    (Wiener, Easton), <strong>strategic interaction</strong> (Schelling, Nash, Putnam),
                    and <strong>institutional analysis</strong> (Tsebelis, Bueno de Mesquita, Ostrom),
                    informed by political and moral philosophy (Arendt, Berlin, Habermas).
                    It assumes that outcomes emerge less from individual psychology than from the
                    <strong>geometry of constraints and incentives</strong> in which actors move.

                <p class="stat-desc">
                    Every conflict system is modeled as a circuit between abstract roles. These are the
                    primitives that Tacitus uses when it reads email threads, draft texts, or board minutes.

                            but often with higher risk tolerance. Tacitus tracks where their escalation paths

                            Following Tsebelis, a veto player is any actor whose consent is required to change
                            course: boards, key ministries, courts, pivotal shareholders, local authorities.
                            The ontology tracks <em>how many</em> exist, <em>how far apart</em> they are,
                            and <em>how cohesive</em> they remain. This drives Tacitus’ assessment of
                            policy stickiness and reform difficulty.

                            Building on selectorate theory, Tacitus distinguishes between broad selectorates

                            (whose support is strictly necessary for survival). Changes that shrink the winning
                            coalition or alter its composition are flagged as structurally sensitive moves.

                            risk in the other – for example, how a protest movement (discursive) increases
                            the cost of repression (kinetic), or how a failed military action collapses a

                            Inspired by Putnam’s two-level games, Tacitus models the space of outcomes each
                            veto player can accept. The overlap between these spaces – the Win-Set – is where
                            agreements are structurally viable. When that overlap shrinks or vanishes, the
                            system moves into pre-conflict conditions and Prism Lab begins to treat polarization
                            signals as early-warning indicators.

                    Once actors and relationships are mapped, Tacitus computes a set of shared metrics.
                    These metrics travel with the case: the Conflict Intelligence Engine uses them to
                    surface options, Prism Lab uses them to track polarization, and the Ontology Graph
                    visualizes them as node sizes, glows, and trajectories.

                            often become spoilers or desperate compromise-seekers; Tacitus highlights them either way.

                    The Tacitus ontology is deliberately <strong>cross-domain</strong>. The same primitives
                    describe a national peace process, a corporate board dispute, a regulatory fight, or an
                    inheritance deadlock. Below are the main actor families Tacitus uses when it rewrites
                    raw communication into a structural map.

                            departs from “pure embeddings”: relationships, veto paths, and coalition geometry
                            become first-class objects.

                            then query the case: <em>“What sequences of moves re-open a Win-Set?”</em>,
                            <em>“Who must be reassured for this reform to stick?”</em>, or
