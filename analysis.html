                    The Tacitus Ontology is a <strong>structural language for conflict and pre-conflict systems</strong>.
                    It underpins everything Tacitus does: continuous monitoring of disputes, mapping trajectories
                    of polarization, and generating <span class="accent">resolution pathways</span> instead of

                <p class="stat-desc">
                    Modern institutions live inside <strong>permanent turbulence</strong>:
                    email chains, board minutes, legal memos, social media cycles, diplomatic cables.
                    The volume of conflictual information grows faster than any team’s ability to
                    follow its structure. That mismatch creates a <strong>Resolution Gap</strong>:
                    we detect more friction and polarization than we can systematically resolve.

                <p class="stat-desc">
                    Tacitus addresses this by treating every conflict or pre-conflict situation as a
                    <strong>system of interacting actors, interests, constraints, and trajectories of polarization</strong>.
                    The aim is <strong>continuous, automated understanding</strong>:
                    who can move what, at what cost, and how today’s decisions change tomorrow’s
                    risk of escalation or breakdown.

                <p class="stat-desc">
                    The ontology sits at the intersection of <strong>systems thinking</strong> (Norbert Wiener,
                    David Easton), <strong>strategic interaction</strong> (Schelling, Nash, Putnam),
                    and <strong>institutional analysis</strong> (Tsebelis, Bueno de Mesquita, Ostrom),
                    informed by political and moral philosophy (Arendt, Berlin, Habermas).
                    It assumes that outcomes emerge less from the psychology of leaders than from
                    the <strong>geometry of constraints and incentives</strong> in which they operate.

                            Actors or coalitions currently occupying the centre:
                            executives, ruling coalitions, dominant factions.
                            They are anchored in the logics of <em>survival</em> and
                            <em>maintenance</em>, not transformation.

                            Those seeking to shift or displace the status quo:
                            opposition blocs, reform coalitions, insurgent teams.
                            They operate under tighter resource constraints but often with
                            higher risk tolerance.

                        <p>
                            Following Tsebelis, a veto player is any actor whose consent
                            is required to change course.
                            The ontology tracks how many exist, how far apart they are,
                            and how cohesive they remain.

                        <h4>Selectorates</h4>
                        <p>
                            Building on selectorate theory, Tacitus distinguishes between broad
                            selectorates (those who could influence leadership) and narrower
                            winning coalitions (whose support is strictly necessary for survival).

                        <h4>Kinetic &amp; Discursive Planes</h4>
                        <p>
                            Power operates through bodies and assets (kinetic) and through
                            narrative and legitimacy (discursive). The ontology encodes how shocks
                            in one plane reprice risk in the other.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Win-Set Geometry</h4>
                        <p>
                            Inspired by Putnam’s two-level games, Tacitus models the space of outcomes
                            each veto player can accept. When that overlap shrinks or collapses,
                            pre-conflict conditions emerge.

                    The point is not to moralize the actors, but to make the <strong>structure visible</strong>:
                    who must move, who must be reassured, who can credibly guarantee, and which sequences of
                    steps could re-open a viable Win-Set.
