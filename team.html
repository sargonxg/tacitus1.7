        <p class="stat-desc">
            Tacitus.me is building a world-class <strong>Conflict Intelligence &amp; Resolution Technology Suite</strong> —
            a system designed to give <em>clarity</em> to anyone facing a dispute:  
            executives, mediators, teams, families, negotiators, policymakers, and institutions.  
            Our mission is simple and radical:
        </p>

        <p class="stat-desc" style="margin-top:0.8rem;">
            <strong>Unlock common ground at scale.</strong>  
            Reveal structure where others see chaos.  
            Use AI not to inflame division, but to <strong>improve deliberation, harmony, and early detection</strong>  
            of conflict precursors like polarization.  
            Tacitus is built for a world where noise is high, trust is low, and decisions cannot wait.

                    Also a lifelong student of baroque music, harmony, and the mathematics of counterpoint —
                    influences that quietly shape Tacitus’ aesthetic: <strong>clarity, balance, structure</strong>.

                    A role for someone who wants to build <strong>a new field</strong>:  
                    AI that reduces conflict rather than amplifying it.
